# AgriTech-Chatbot-with-LLama3.2
**Overview**

The AI AgriTech Agent is a specialized digital assistant built to help farmers diagnose and manage plant diseases through actionable treatment recommendations. Powered by a large language model (LLM) – in this case, the LLama 3.2 model – it provides real-time, interactive advice tailored to the needs of modern agriculture. The agent is designed to function within a Jupyter Notebook environment, making it accessible and interactive for users who require up-to-date insights into crop health.

**Key Features**


Real-Time Interaction:
The agent leverages streaming responses to ensure that farmers receive continuous, real-time feedback as they input queries about crop diseases.

**User-Centric Conversational Interface:**

With a focus on usability, the interactive chat system maintains a dynamic conversation history, providing context and clarity throughout the discussion.

**Multilingual Support:**
The system can respond in various languages – as demonstrated by the example in Arabic – which broadens its usability for farmers in different regions.

**Targeted Recommendations:**
Beyond general advice, the AI AgriTech Agent offers detailed treatment recommendations that consider the severity of the disease, environmental conditions, and other relevant factors.

**Technical Components**
Ollama Integration:
The agent uses the ollama module to interact with the underlying chat model. This integration allows it to send prompts to the LLM and stream responses back to the user.

Interactive Streaming Functionality:
The stream_AgriTech_response function initiates a streaming session with the model. It yields each part of the response as it becomes available, ensuring that users can see updates in real-time.

Chat History Management:
An ongoing list of chat history is maintained during the session. This allows the system to display a full conversational context, making it easier for users to track previous questions and recommendations.

Jupyter Notebook Display:
Using IPython.display functions, the agent clears and updates the display dynamically. This ensures that the user interface remains clean and the latest responses are highlighted.

**Workflow**

User Query:
The farmer enters a query regarding a specific plant disease, such as "potato early blight."

Streaming Response:
The system sends the query to the LLM, which begins streaming its recommendations back to the user. Each chunk of the response is displayed in real-time, providing immediate feedback.

Contextual Display:
The conversation history is continuously updated and rendered in Markdown format, keeping the interaction organized and easy to follow.

Exit Mechanism:
The agent allows the user to terminate the session gracefully by typing 'exit', ensuring a user-friendly experience.

Use Case Example
A typical session might involve a farmer asking for treatment recommendations for potato early blight disease in Arabic. The agent processes the query, streams back detailed treatment guidelines (including the use of fungicides, bactericides, and pest control measures), and provides additional context regarding environmental factors and the need for tailored strategies.
